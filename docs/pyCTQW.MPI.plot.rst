.. caution::
    The functions available in this submodule have been
    designed to work with classes in the :class:`pyCTQW.MPI` module; that is, they are
    being called implicitly by the above classes, invisible to the user.

    It is not recommended that they be used by themselves, however it is
    possible to do so.
