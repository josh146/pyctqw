==================================
pyCTQW's Manual
==================================

**Features**

Contains distributed memory methods for calculating:
    * the continuous-time quantum walk on arbitrary graphs and lines for 1, 2 and 3 particles
    * Non-interacting and interacting walks
    * Entanglement calculations
    * ability to place diagonal defects/barriers on graph vertices
    * contains MPI graph isomorphism methods, for both 2 and 3 interacting particles

These classes also contain plotting methods, to visualise the quantum walking dynamics
